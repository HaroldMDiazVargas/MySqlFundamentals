Database:
    A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed

In order to manage our databases, we use a software app call: Database Management System DBMS
We connect to a given DBMS and give it instructions for querying or modify data
The DBMS executes our instructions and send results back

PC----------------> DBMS ----------------------> Database

We have several DBMS classify into 2 categories:
1. Relational: We store data in tables that are link to each other using relationships
    that's why we call these dbs relational. Each table stores data about specific type of object like customers, orders, products, so on

    Structured Query Language(SQL): The language we use to work with these Relational Databases Management Systems(RDBMS)
                                    We use SQL to query or modify our data
    Some of the most popular of RDBMS are:
        MySQL
        SQL Server by Microsoft
        Oracle 
    Most of SQL will work with any RDBMS

2. No Relational or NoSQL: We dont have tables or relationships
    these databases are very diferent for relational databases
    NoSQL systems don't understand SQL. They have their own query language
