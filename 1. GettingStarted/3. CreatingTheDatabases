MySQL Workbench interface
    In the top left side we have buttons for creating a new tab for writing new SQL code
    as well as opening a SQL file. Next we have bunch of buttons for creating a database,
    creating tables, so on.

    Left side we have Navigator panel with 2 tabs:
        Administration tab: to do administrate work such a starting or stopping our server, importing or exporting
                            data and so on
        Schemas: shows the databases that we have in the current database server. Currently we have 1 database that
                is 'sys', this is the database that MySQL uses internally to do its work
    
    In the middle: where we write our SQL code, so we expend most of the time in this windows
    
    Right side we have another panel with 2 tabs:
        Context Help 
        Snippets
     


Creating database:
    Download .zip file attached, this has a bunch of SQL files. 
    
    The main one we use is 'create-databases.sql' this file contains all the SQL code to create all the 
    databases that we use here.

    We also have another individuals SQL files for creating individuals database. We just have these files
    in case we create databases in the future.


In MySQL Workbench:
    Open 'create-database.sql'
    Run click on yellow thunder to execute a selection or if there's not selection, all the SQL code.
    We get all databases prefix with sql_, to avoid has same name of other database in our database server
        sql_hr
        sql_inventory
        sql_invoicing
        sql_store

    For each database we have:
        Tables: where we store our data
        Views: Kind like a virtual tables, we can combine data from multiple tables and put them in a view
                very powerful for creating reports.
        Stored Procedures: Program stored inside of our database for querying data.
                           e.x we can have a stored procedure for getting all the customer of a given city
                               so, we call that procedure and ask to give us all the customer in Pereira.
        Functions: Program stores inside of our database for querying data

    
    For sql_store database:
        Tables: we have the next tables
                customers
                orders
                products
                shippers
                ...
                if we select one of these table, we see 3 icons:
                    right icon(table with a thunder): we can see all the data in this table
                        e.x customers table we can see column customer_id(unique id), first_name, last_name, so on
                            every row is called a record. Every row represent one customer.
                        e.x orders table we can see columns like order_id, customer_id, order_data, status, so on
                            customer_id is used to identify who has placed each other
                            The interesting part here, if customer may place multiple orders in our system
                            everytime that customer place order, we need to look at his address, phone to ship order
                            is possible this information change in future. If we repeat all these information next to
                            each other, we need to come back and replace this new information in multiple places.
                            So instead of changing information about given customer, we just come back to customers table
                            and in orders table we dont modify nothing.
                            This is RELATIONAL databases: Multiple tables that are related to each other using a relationship
