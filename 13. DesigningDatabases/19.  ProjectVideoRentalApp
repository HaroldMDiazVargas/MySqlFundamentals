Project Video Rental App
    See the requirements for app called Vidly.
    This app is going to be used in a Video Rental Store. 
    Design a Datab Model for this app.


Conceptual Model
    We can extract from the requirements, different entities:

    User: We have different users, so we assume each user must have an username an password as attributes.

    Permission: We have differente permissions, we assume each permission has a description(name, about)

    Customer: Each customer has name, email and phone

    Movie: Each movie have a barcode, the daily rental rate for each movie and the stock(quantity) available
           for each movie. Here we can also put the movie name, but is not required.

    Rental: This entity appears from the relationship between the Customer and Movie entities, because 
            the number of days that a customer has a movie is an attribute of this relationship. 
    
    Coupon: This entity we assume that may have a code(unique coupon), descripcion, discount of this offer.
            Is related with Rental entity.
