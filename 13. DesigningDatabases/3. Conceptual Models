Conceptual Models
    Imagine to build a webpage for buying online courses. 

    First we need to create a CONCEPTUAL MODEL that represents the entities, things or concepts in this business
    and their relationships with each other. Quite often these entities are things like people, events, 
    locations and so on. 

    Â¿What concepts or entities do we have here ?
        Student
        Course

    We need a way to visually see these entities and their relationships. There're 2 ways to do this:
        - Entity Relationship(ER) Diagrams: Are often used for Data Modelling
        - Unified Modeling Language(UML) Diagrams: Goes go way beyond Data Modelling
    These are both equally good when it comes to building Conceptual and Logical Data Models. 

    Here we'll use ER Diagrams. There're various tools out there for creating ER Diagrams:
        - Microsoft Visio: On windows
        - draw.io:  Popular online tool
        - LucidCharts: Popular onlin tool
    
    Usin draw.io:
        -  Left side we can see various kind of visual languages like UML, ER, FlowChart, so on.
        - Student Entity: In ER, we see Entity object and we can add to a diagram
                          We can rename this entity object e.g Student 
                          Inside this box we can list all the attributes we need to know about each Student
                            e.g name, email, dateRegister, so on. Using camal notation
        - Course Entity: Create a new Entity a rename it to Course
                     git     Inside we list all the attribute we need to know about the course
                            e.g title, price, instructor, tags
        - Define relationships between entities: We have various kind of relationships, we'll see them soon. 
                        we select a Many to Many relationship ad attach the Student Entity(left side)
                        with the Course Entity(right side). 
        - Label to the relationship: Just double click over the relationship and type 'enrolls'
                                    And we read the relationship from left to right:
                                    " Stuent enrolls Course"


                
    Notes: Data Modelling is an iterating processing, we can't come with a perfect design in the 1st attemp
           we need to constantly goes back and for between the requirements and our Models and keep refine 
           them. e.g rename any attribute of any Entity, remove or add more, so on.

            Conceptual Model gives a very high level overview of the business domain and the things involve
            in this domain, we dont have any details about the type of each attribute. Neither do we know or 
            care what DBMS we're gonna use to implement this Model, This is just a Conceptual Model used to 
            comunicate with the business stakeholder, to know both are on the same page and we talk the same 
            language.
