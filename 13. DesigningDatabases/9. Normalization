Normalization 
    Before go ahead and generate our database tables, we need to be sure that our design is optimal and doesn't
    allow redundant or duplicated data. Because redundancy increases the size of our database and complicates
    the INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operations.

    e.x If name of someone is repeated in different places and they decide to change their name, we have to
        update several different places. If we dont update in the different places we will have inconsistence 
        data and this gives us invalid reports.
    
    Normalization is the process of reviewing our design and ensure that it follows a few predefined rules 
    that prevent data duplications. There're seven rules called 7 Normal Forms. Each rule assumes that 
    we have applied the previous rule.

    For almost 99% of the apps => we only need to apply the first 3 Normal Forms
    - 1st Normal Form
    - 2nd Normal Form
    - 3rd Normal Form

    We don't really to worry about the other Normal Forms.
