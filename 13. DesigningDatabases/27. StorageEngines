Storage Engines
    Quick overview of Storage Engines.

    In MySQL we have several Storage Engines. These determinate how the data store and what features are 
    available to us

    - SHOW ENGINES 
      we can see all Storage Engines supported by the current version of MySQL
      Engine, Support, Comment, Transactions, XA, Savepoints
        The 2 most Storage Engines are:
        - MyISAM: Older Storage Engine, used to be popular in version < 5.5. Dont use
        - InnoDB: Superior Storage Engine,support features as Transactions and all features we've worked on.
                  
    There're situations when we're working with databases with older version of MySQL, and we want to 
    grow that database to use InnoDB to add e.g Foreign Keys.
    To change the Storage Engine:
        - We can change at table-level visually:
          In the same database we can use multiple Storage Engines. We open drop-down list in design mode(top)
          We can select the Engine: InnoDB(default).
        
        - We can change at table-leve using SQL
          ALTER TABLE tableName
          ENGINE = InnoDB
        
    

    Note:
        Change Storage Engine for a table is an expensive operation, MySQL will rebuild the table. During the time
        our table is not going to be accessible. So dont do in production unless we have schedule maintaince.
