Designing Databases
    We've written our queries agains existing databases. But there're times we need to:
     - design our new databases from scratch 
     - add new tables to the existing databases


    The idea is designed a well-structured database. A well desgined database requires:
     - Quite planning at begining (take a time), this is critical for the sucess of our app
     
    If database is designed propertly :
     - Support mew business requirements
     - Easily query to extract useful information and queries will execute quickly
     - Low maintainance
     - Scalable
