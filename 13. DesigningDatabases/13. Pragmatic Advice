Pragmatic Advice
    Dont worry about the memorize about all these NF rules exactly.

    When working in real world just focus on removing redundancy, dont apply Normalization Rules to each 
    table and each column. 

    So whenever we see duplicated values and are not Foreign Keys like 1, 2, 3 ,... that means our design is not
    normalize. What normalization is ? Not matter, doesnt care about that stuff. 






Don't Model the Universe
    One of the mistakes that a lot of Data Modellers make is try to generalize their models. So they can 
    support future requirements. 
    Most of the time, these future requirements are just in the head => They may never happen
    So they create a Model that is already complex => USELESS!

    Remember:
        - Scope of the project
        - Context of the project
        - Requirements of the project
    
    So => Develop the best solution for TODAY'S problems, not future problems that may never happen

    In real world:
    - people may change their legal name => dont add a previous name column in our customer table 
    - People move houses => dont worry about supporting multiple address if all we need is just the customer CURRENT address.
    
    Only worry about these unless is really important for our problem domain!

    In conclusion:
     - Don't buil a model for the universe or real life
     - Instead build a model for our problem domain based on the current requirements, not what happens in real 
       world
