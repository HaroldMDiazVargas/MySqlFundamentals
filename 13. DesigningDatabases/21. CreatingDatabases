Creating and Dropping Databases
    We have learnt how to use the Wizards in MySQL Workbench to create and updating databases. But we need to 
    understand the script that these tools generate, to review it and ensure that doesn't have any bad 
    impact in our database.


    - Create an empty database:
        Syntax:
            CREATE DATABASE databaseName;
            CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS databaseName; => better approach is optional
    - Drop a database:
        Syntax:
            DROP DATABASE databaseName;
            DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS databaseName;       => better approach
