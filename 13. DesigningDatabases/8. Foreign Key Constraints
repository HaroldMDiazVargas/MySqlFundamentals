Foreign Key Constraints
    Whenever we have a Foreign Key in a table => we need to set the Constraints of that Foreign Key, basically
    protects our data from getting corrupted.


    In enrollments table: We have 2 Foreign Keys
                         - student_id
                         - course_id 
                         The combination of these two columns, forms the Primary Key in this table.

                        click over this table => in buttom we can see Foreign Keys tab
                        We can see we have 2 Foreign Keys, by convention we use 'fk_foregnkeytable_primarykeytable' as naming

                        - Foreign Key Name:
                            - fk_enrollments_students: this means this Foreign Key references the students table
                            - fk_enrollments_courses1: this means this Foreign Key references the courses table
                                                       MySQL adds '1,..' at the end to prevent for clashing 
                                                       with another Foreign Key in the database. But here we know 
                                                       there's not other Foreign Key with this name => rename to remove 
                                                       1 from the end.
                        - Foreign Key Options(constraints):
                            In the right-side we can see a drop-down list to what should happen when the corresponding
                            record in the Primary Key Table(Parent) gets updated or deleted:
                            - RESTRICT
                            - CASCADE
                            - SET NULL
                            - NO ACTION
                            e.x In the unlikely event that the Primary Key of a table changes(bad practice), but 
                                we want to make sure that the Foreign Key Table is updated
                            - In Update drop-down list:
                                - RESTRICT: This will reject the update from happening
                                - CASCADE: We select CASCADE, to MySQL automatically update the records in the Child 
                                          table if the Primary Key changes.  
                                - SET NULL: This will set Foreign Key to NULL if the Primary Key of a record changes.
                                            We will end with a child record that doesn't have a parent(orphan record)
                                            we dont want these records because are bad data.
                                - NO ACTION: Exactly the same that RESTRICT, prevents or rejects the update operation
                            
                            - In Delete drop-down list:
                                - RESTRICT: Reject the delete operation.
                                - CASCADE: If we delete one record in the child table, this means the corresponding record in 
                                           the parent table will get deleted by MySQL. We should do this depending of the context
                                           e.x In this case in enrollments table we are storing 'financial' information and then
                                               we can see how much we have sold, what courses have been most popular, so on.

                                - SET NULL
                                - NOT ACTION: Reject the delete operation, same as RESTRICT


                            - Set Constraints for the Foreign Keys:
                                - fk_enrollments_students:
                                                            - On Updated: CASCADE
                                                            - On Delete: NO ACTION or RESTRICT
                                - fk_enrollments_courses:
                                                            - On Updated: CASCADE
                                                            - On Delete: NO ACTION or RESTRICT
                                
                                
                            Notes:
                            
                                 If a student has at least 1 enrollment record => we shouldn't be able to delete that student
                                                                                 unless we delete the enrollment first

                                 If a course has at least 1 enrollment record => we shouldn't be able to delete that course
                                                                                 unless we delete the enrollment first
