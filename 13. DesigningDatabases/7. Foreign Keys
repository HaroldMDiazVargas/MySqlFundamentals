Foreign Keys
    Foreign Key => Column in one table that references the PK of another table (is mark with a red diamond)
    We need to analyze the relationships before define PK for enrollments table
    Whenever we add a relationship between 2 tables, we will have:
        - The Parent or Primary Key table
        - The Child or Foreign Key table


    Adding relationships:

        - students and enrollments: In this case the students is the Primary Key table, because we can not have
                                    an enrollment without have a student first. When adding a relationship
                                    we need to select:
                                        - first select the Foreign Key table  => enrollments table
                                        - then select the Primary Key table => students table
                                    then we will see that MySQL added new column(red diamond) in enrollments table:
                                        - students_student_id INT => this column is referencing the student_id column
                                                                    in the students table.
                                                                    Rename to => student_id
                                        
        - courses and enrollments: In this case tue courses is the Primary Key table. Again when addin a 
                                   relationship:
                                        - first select the Foreign Key table => enrollments table
                                        - then select the Primary Key table => courses table
                                    then we will see new column in erollments table:
                                        - courses_course_id => rename to => course_id 


    Adding PK in the enrollments table:
        - We have two choices:
            - 1. Combination of student_id and course_id to unique identify each enrollment. So we can use 
                 a composite PK.
            - 2. Introduce a new column called enrollment_id, set it to AI.
        There's not hard and fast rule(no one is better than other):
            - The benefit of 1st approach is that prevents us for accidentally enrolling the same student 
              in the same course twice. However, if we have another table in the future and it's going to be
              relationship between the enrollments and that new table, these two keys need to be repeated
              in that table as the Foreign Key. Depending on the context is not always a bad thing, depends:
              amount of data we have and wheter that table also has another Child table.
            
            - The benefit of 2nd approach we wont have the problem of the 1st approach, so if we have another 
              table in the future with a Parent-Child relationship between enrollments and that table, we only
              have to repeat enrollment_id(PK) => only 1 value, 1 integer instead of 2.

        However CURRENTLY we dont have a Child table relationship with enrollments table. So there's not need
        to design for that scenarious may not happen in the future. So in this case, is better to use
        the 1st approach => protect table for Bad Data. And if in future appear a Child table we can always 
        come back and revisit design, change and update the design of the tables.

        So finally => Mark PK for both student_id and course_id columns in the enrollments table
                      and move to top!
