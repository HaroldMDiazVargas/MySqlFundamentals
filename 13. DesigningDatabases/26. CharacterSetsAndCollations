Character Sets and Collations
    Character Set: When we store a string MySQL will convert each character to its numeric representation 
                   using a Character Set. So a Character Set is table that maps each character to a number.

        Collation: Is a bunch of rules that determinate how the characters in a given language are sorted.

    SHOW CHARSET => We can see all Character Sets supported by the current version of MySQL
        Chaset, Description, Default collation and Maxlen
            Charsets:
                - armscii8
                - big5 tradition chinese
                - utf8: we can store characters pretty much in most international languages
                        this is the DEFAULT used by MySQL in version >= 5.
            
            Default collation:
                - for utf8 the defaul collation is utf8_general_ci
                 ci is short for Case Insensitive(MySQL treats lower/upper case the same when come to sorted)
                 We dont need really to change the collation

            Maxlen:
                - for utf8 the Maxlen is 3, this means MySQL reserves a maximum of 3bytes for storing each character
                  we saw early:
                    - english: MySQL reserves 1 byte
                    - western/european/middle east reserves 2 bytes
                    - asian languages use 3 bytes
                

    We dont have to worry abput changing the Character Set. But there're cases where we may change it to
    reduce our database size: 
        - if we set datatype of CHAR(10) MySQL will reserve 10 x 3 = 30 x 1000000(records) = 30M

    But if we change to latin1 Charset => MySQL will reserve only 1 byte for each character
        - we reduce to 10M bytes

    
    Change Character Set:
     Visual way:
        - right click on database 
        - click on Schema Inspector
          - We can see the default collation and default characterset.

        - Now in design mode of a table
          - we can select a column and below we see Default Charset and Default Collation
            additional, we can toggle a vertical arrow to see again the Default Charset/Collation
        
        So with this way we can change at table-level, not to database-level.


     Using SQL
        With this way we can change Charset at database-level an also at table-level and even to a particular column
        See queries.





-- Query1 - See all Character Sets
SHOW CHARSET


-- Query2 - Set Character Set when creating a database
CREATE DATABASE db_name
    CHARACTER SET latin1


-- Query3 - Set Character Set on an existing database
ALTER DATABASE db_name
    CHARACTER SET latin1


-- Query4 - Set Character Set when creating a table(table-level)
CREATE TABLE table1
(
    ...
    ...
)
CHARACTER SET latin1                  


-- Query5 - Set Character Set on an existing table
ALTER TABLE table1
CHARACTER SET latin1   


-- Query6 - Set Character Set to a particular column
CREATE TABLE table1
(
    ...
    first_name VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL...,
    ...
)
