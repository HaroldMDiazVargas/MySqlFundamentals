Primary Keys
    We need to add a Primary Key to each table
    PK => column that uniques indentify each record in a given table.
          Ideally PK value shouldn't change, ideally must be keep the same value forever

    students table:
        - we can't not use first_name, last_name, neither the composite of both.
        - email certainly unique identify each record, but the problem is the several length
          and if we use this, we need to repeat this column in enrollments table to define the relationship
          That's not good idea, because we're repeating several characters. Also, a student can change 
          the email later on. 
        - We introduce a new column => ID column, we use that as Primary Key
            - add new column:
                - student_id INT => mark as PK an NN must mark automatically and also mark as AI
                                    also by convention move to top this column

    courses table:
        - Here we also introduce a new column
            - add new column:
                - course_id INT => mark as PK and also mark as AI(auto increment)
