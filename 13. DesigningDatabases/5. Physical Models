Physical Models
    The implementation of the Logical Model for specific database tecnhology.
    We're going to take Logical Model and create a Physical Data Model for MySQL.

    In MySQL workbench:
        - File => New Model
            We can see:
            - + Add Diagram to create EER (Enhance Entity Relationship)
                for create any relationship diagrams
            
            - By default this Model assumes a database called 'mydb'
                we can right click => Edit schema => rename e.g school
            
            So on top + Add Diagram:
                - Here we can add tables and views.
                - Add a new table1 => double click:
                    - rename it => students
                    - add columns:
                        - first_name  VARCHAR(50)
                        - last_name VARCHAR(50)
                        - email VARCHAR(255)
                        - date_registered DATETIME
                
                - Add a new table => enrollments
                    - add columns:
                        - date DATETIME
                        - price DECIMAL(5, 2)
                
                - Add a new table => courses
                    - add columns:
                        - title VARCHAR(255)
                        - price DECIMAL(5, 2)
                        - instructor VARCHAR(255)
                        - tags VARCHAR(255)
                



            

    Notes: 
        When becomes to name our tables, personally prefer to name them in plural.
         but we can name in singular. Remember stick the same convention name.
        
        MySQL name convention is to name a column => separate by underscore '_'

        Consistence in the tables: In courses table we define all length VARCHAR 255 to keep consistency
                                   In enrollments table we have the same 5, 2 for DECIMAL equal to price in courses table.
