Data Modelling
    Is the process of creating a Model for the data that we want to store in the database. This Data Modelling
    involves 4 steps:
     1. First we understand and analize the business requirements. Many developers jump this step and jump to 
        creating tables in a database. This is the most important step, is a bit slow and takes times but
        the better we understan the business problem we are trying to solve the better we can come with a 
        solution, in this case the database.
        We need to talk to the business stakeholders, domain experts and event end-user, looking at the existing
        forms, documents, apps, spreadsheets, databases and anything relevant to the problem domain we're 
        working on. In simple words is Collecting Information.
     2. Then we build a CONCEPTUAL MODEL of the business. This involces identify the entities or things, concepts 
        in the business and the relationship with each other. A Conceptual Model is a visual representation
        of these concepts that we use to cominucate with the stakeholders, so we know both are in the same 
        page.
    3.  Next we define to come with a data Model or data structure for storing data => called a LOGICAL MODEL.
        Logical Model is an abstract data dodel that is independent of database tecnhology, it just shows us 
        the tables and columns we need.
    4.  Next we refine this Logical Model to build a PHYSICAL MODEL for specific DBMS. A Physical Model is 
        the implementation of Logical Model for a particular database tecnhology(like MySQL), in this Model we should 
        have the exact datatypes supported by our database tecnhology, the default values for our columns,
        whether they are NULLABLE, the primary keys for our tables, as well as other objects like 
        Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers and so on.
