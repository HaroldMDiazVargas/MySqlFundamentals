Altering Primary/Foreign Key Constraints
    Drop or create relationships between tables that already exist.
    We forgot to type FOREIGN KEY constrain to a table. So we forgot to create the relationship.
    We can use ALTER TABLE statement we used earlier, to add/drop the FOREIGN KEY in a given table. Also 
    we can use to add/drop PRIMARY KEY

    Syntax:
        ALTER TABLE tableName
            ADD PRIMARY KEY (columnNamePartOfThisPK),                => set the primary key
            DROP PRIMARY KEY,                                       => we dont need to specify the name of the columns
            DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_childTable_parentTable,
            ADD FOREIGN KEY fk_childTable_parentTable (columnName)
                REFERENCES parentTable (primaryKeyOfParentTable)
                ON UPDATE behaviour 
                ON DELETE behaviour;

ALTER TABLE orders 
    ADD PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
    DROP PRIMARY KEY,
    DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers,
    ADD FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers (customer_id)
        REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
        ON DELETE NO ACTION;
