Project: Flight Booking System
    Design a database for a Flight Booking System(see pdf) to see an example of a ticket that this 
    system should generate.
    Based on this information design the database.



-- Conceptual Model
    Based on the information we can see extract different entities:
     - Passenger
     - Flight
     - Airline
     - Airport
     - Aircraft

    Passenger Entity:
        - Here we only need the name of the passenger. In a real world we can add address, email, phone, so on. 
          But in the requirements based on the information of busineess => we dont see these attributes.

    Flight Entity:
        - Here we see Number of flight, DepartureDateTime, ArrivalDateTime, Duration of the flight, 
          Distance total of the flight and the Airline name. 

    Airline Entity:
        - Here we only should need the name of the Airline. However, we put it in Flight Entity. 
          We dont add this here for now, because that's something about Normalization Form.

    Airport Entity:
        - About this entity, we see IATACode, name of the airport, state and city where is located.
          We also could have Country, but here we're assuming according the requirements that are only 
          National Flights.
    
    Ticket Entity:
        - This appears from the rekationship between Passenger-Flight Entity. Because the ticketNumber, 
          flightClass, price and confirmationNumber are not attributes of the passenger. These are attributes
          of the 'Booking' when a passenger books a flight is the only way these attributes appear.

    
    Notes:
        Finally we just put many-to-many relationships just to define a relationship BUT this is not the 
        real relationship. We analyze with more detail in the Logical Model.
