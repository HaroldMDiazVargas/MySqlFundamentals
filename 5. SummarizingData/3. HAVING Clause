The HAVING Clause
    we can not use WHERE clause in situation when we GROUP BY our data after the WHERE clause. So we can not
        filter here using WHERE clause. Instead we use HAVING clause.
    The columns we use in HAVING clause have to be part of SELECT clause, we can not reference columns that
        are not included in our SELECT clause

    This clause we filter data after we group our records.
    Syntax:
        SELECT..
        FROM..
        GROUP BY..
        HAVING condition

    e.x get the total sales as well as the number of invoices by client_id. But only get these clients whose 
        total_sales are greater than 500 and more than 5 invoices
        SELECT 
            client_id,
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
            COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
        FROM invoices
        GROUP BY client_id
        HAVING total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5


    

Exercise. Get the customers who are located in Virginia and spent more than $100

USE sql_store;

SELECT
    customer_id, 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    state,
    SUM(quantity*unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
    USING(customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi
    USING(order_id)
WHERE state = 'VA'
GROUP BY customer_id, first_name, last_name
HAVING total_sales > 100
