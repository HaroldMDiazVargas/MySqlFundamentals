The GROUP BY Clause
    group data by 1 or more columns in order to compute e.x aggregate function like SUM by a given condition
    The GROUP BY Clause is always after FROM and WHERE clause but before ORDER BY clause.
    Syntax:
        GROUP BY column

        GROUP BY column1, column2 => combination if in the table exists

    e.x get the amount of invoice_total(total sales) by client
        SELECT 
            client_id,
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM invoices
        WHERE invoice_date >= '2019-07-01'
        GROUP BY client_id
        ORDER BY total_sales DESC

    e.x get the total sales by city and state combination. For this join invoices table with clients table
        SELECT 
            state,
            city,
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM invoices
        JOIN clients
            USING (client_id)
        GROUP BY state, city
    

Exercise. Report of 3 columns date, payment_method an total_payments. We can see total_payments for each date
          and payment_method combination.

USE sql_invoicing;
SELECT 
    date,
    pm.name AS payment_method,
    SUM(amount) AS total_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY date, payment_method
