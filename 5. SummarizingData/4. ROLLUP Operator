The ROLLUP Operator
    Only in MySQL we have a powerful operator for summaryzing data called WITH ROLL UP
    This is used to summaryzes our entire result cell => Sum of total 
    This operator only is applied to columns that aggregate values

    When we use GROUP BY clause and group by multiple columns. And at the same time we use ROLLUP operator,
    we see summary values for each group as well as the entire result set.

    Syntax:
        ...
        GROUP BY columnName WITH ROLLUP


    e.x get the total_sales by client_id. And also the result of total_sales by all clients
        USE sql_invoicing;
        SELECT
            client_id,
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM invoices
        GROUP BY client_id WITH ROLLUP

    e.x get the total_sales by state and city. An also see the result of total_sales by each state(across different
        citys in the same state) and finally the total sales of all states.
        USE sql_invoicing;
        SELECT
            state,
            city,
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM clients
        JOIN invoices
            USING(client_id)
        GROUP BY state, city WITH ROLLUP


Exercise. Produce report => payment_method and total. To see the total for each payment_method as well as the
                            total amount we have received

-- Query

USE sql_invoicing;

SELECT 
    pm.name AS payment_method,
    SUM(amount) AS total
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY pm.name WITH ROLLUP
