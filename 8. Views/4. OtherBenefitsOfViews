Other benefits of views
    Views can help to simplify our queries. But there're couple more benefits of using views:
        - Views can reduce the impact of changes to our database design
            e.g imaigne we have few queries writen of a certain table. In future, we decide to make a change
                in the table like rename table, rename column, move a column to a different table, etc.
                so we have to come back and fix all the queries that reference that table
            But if all queries are based on a view. So the only place we need to change is in the VIEW. 
            These queries will not be affected by a change in the underline table.
        - We can use views to restrict acces to the data in the underline table.
            e.g In our view we can use WHERE clause to filter records or may exclude some columns of the underline
                tables. If we remove direct access to the table => so user can only update dates throught our
                views and the user will not be able to modify the value of a certain column or modify the rows
                that are not returned througt our view.

    Note: Don't apply these benefits to every situation, just remember all these benefits that can 
          we make with views.
