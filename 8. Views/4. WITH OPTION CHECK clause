The WITH OPTION CHECK clause
    With this we want to prevent that views disappear records when these views are UPDATE or DELETE. 
    We dont want that a DELETE or UPDATE statement => exclude a row/record from the view.
    It's fine that a DELETE or UPDATE statement modify our view, but not that remove from it(some cases)
    Syntax:
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW .... AS...
        ...
        ...                         => all the SQL code generate the view
        ...
        WITH CHECK OPTION

    e.x update the invoides_with_balance view => set payment_total equal to invoice_total for invoice_id 2, 
        so we will have a balance of 0. Remember that a filter was applied to create the view (balance > 0)

        UPDATE invoices_with_balance
        SET payment_total = invoice_total
        WHERE invoice_id = 2

        -- Then when we refresh the view => invoice number 2 will dispear. This is the default behaviour of views
           So when we update or delete data throught the views, some of the rows may disappear.
           There're times we want to prevent this.

    e.x apply clause to prevent UPDATE or DELETE statements for excluding rows from the view. So we need
        to recreate it.

        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
        SELECT 
            invoice_id,
            number,
            client_id,
            invoice_total,
            payment_total,
            invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
            invoice_date,
            due_date,
            payment_date
        FROM invoices
        WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total) > 0
        WITH CHECK OPTION

        -- when we execute the 1st example again => we get an ERROR
                                                 => CHECK OPTION FAILED
