Altering or Dropping Views
    We may realize that our view has a problem, so we need to change our view. There're 2 ways to do this:
        - Drop the view and recreate it
            Syntax:
                DROP VIEW viewName
        - Use the replace keyword  => We just run as many times as we want
            Syntax:
                CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW viewName AS ...

    Now if we dont have access to the SQL code behind the view. A lot of people save views in SQL files
    and put them in a source control => very common practice to check this files into a git repository and then
    share repository with other people, so everyone can recreate that database in their machine
    
    So save file(query of view) => views/ folder => viewName.sql

    In case we dont do this way, we can always go to the design mode of the view => add new SQL code e.g filter
    and then apply => apply => Done. But this is not the ideal way to save our views


-- clients_balance view in design mode

CREATE 
    ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED 
    DEFINER = `root`@`localhost` 
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
VIEW `sql_invoicing`.`clients_balance` AS
    SELECT 
        `c`.`client_id` AS `client_id`,
        `c`.`name` AS `name`,
        SUM((`i`.`invoice_total` - `i`.`payment_total`)) AS `balance`
    FROM
        (`sql_invoicing`.`clients` `c`
        JOIN `sql_invoicing`.`invoices` `i` ON ((`c`.`client_id` = `i`.`client_id`)))
    GROUP BY `c`.`client_id` , `c`.`name`
