Viewing Indexes
    To view the indexes on a table we can write SQL or see less details in navigator panel.

    Syntax:
        ANALYZE TABLE customers;   => This will regenerate the statistics for this table
        SHOW INDEXES IN tableName;


    
    e.x view indexes of customers table
        SHOW INDEXES IN customers;

        we will see three indexes:
        - PRIMARY KEY => this is the Clustered Index, whenever we add PK to a table MySQL creates an index to 
                         quickly find a record by their id

        - idx_state & idx_points => these are reffered as Secondary Indexes. Whenever we create a secondary index
                                    MySQL creates an id/PK column in the index(internally of the index) 
                                    - id of each customer (PK) and -points (these are entries of the index)
                                      we dont see id here, but is internally stored in the index.

        - Collation => A, this represent how data is sorted in the index A(ascending), we also have 
                        B(descending)
        
        - Cardinality => Represent an estimated number of unique values in the index. 

        - Index_type => BTREE (Binary Tree)

    e.x view indexes of orders table
        SHOW INDEXES IN orders;

        We will see four indexes:
        - PRIMARY KEY
        - fk_orders_customers_idx, fk_orders_shippers_idx, fk_orders_order_statudes_idx => these are Secondary Indexes
            whenever we create a RELATIONSHIP between two tables, MySQL automcally creates an Index on the Foreign Keys 
            so we can quickly JOIN our tables.


    e.x view indexes of customers table to see more accurately values
        ANALYZE TABLE customers; => This will regenerate the statistics for this table 

        SHOW INDEXES IN customers; => Now we will see more accurate values

    
    e.x View indexes in navigator panel
        click on customers table 
         - we can see a folder Indexes
          - we can see various attributes of each index when we click over one index.   
            e.g BTREE No Unique, Visible(means enable) is placed on state column
