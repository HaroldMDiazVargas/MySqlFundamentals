IndexMaintenance    
    Indexes can dramatically improve the performance of our queries. But too much a good thing can be a 
    bad thing.

    We need to watch for:
    - Duplicate indexes: Are indexes on the same set of columns in the same orders. MySQL doesn't stop us 
                         to create duplicate indexes, it will maintain each duplicate index separately.
                         Sometimes we can create them without we aware of it, this happens when create 
                         index without looking at existence index. Always check existent indexes!

    - Redundant indexes: If we have an index in two columns like (A, B) and then create another index 
                         on column A => This is considered redundant, because the formal index can also 
                         optimize the queries that work with column A. However if we create an index 
                         on column B or (B,A) is not redundant. Because these indexes satisfies 
                         different queries

    Always before creating new indexes CHECK the existing ones. Indexes maintenance is very important:
    - make sure to drop:
    - duplicate indexes
    - redundant indexes 
    - unused indexes
