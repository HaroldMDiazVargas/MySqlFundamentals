Transactions in MySQL
    Transaction is a group of SQL statements that represent a single unit of work. All the statements should
    be completed succesfully or the transaction will fail.
    e.g Bank Transaction => when we transfer money, these amount of money should be taken from our account
                             and deposit into our friend's account. There're 2 operations, but these together
                             represent a single unit of work.

    We use Transactions in situations when we want to make multiple changes to the database and we want 
    all these changes to succes or fail together as a single unit.

    e.x Store an order with an item in a database. We need 2 SQL statement to store this order
        - INSERT the order record into orders table
        - INSERT the order item record into order_item table
        But what if server crashed at the same we insert the order item ?
         We ended with an incomplete order => our database is not in a consistence state.
    
    Transactions have few properties(ACID):
        - Atomicity: Means our transactions are like atoms => they're unbreakable.
                     each transaction is a single unit of work no matter how many statements it contains.
        - Consistency: With these transaction our database will always remain in a consistence state
        - Isolation: These trasactions are isolated or protected from each other, even if they try to modify
                     the same data. Only 1 transaction at time can update these rows when are modifying the same
                     data. So, other transactions have to wait to other transaction to be completed.
        - Durability: Once a transaction is commited, the changes made by the transaction are permanent.
                      So if we have a power failed or a system crashed, we're not going to lose the changes.
