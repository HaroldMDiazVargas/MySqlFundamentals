READ COMMITTED Transaction Isolation Level
    Read only commited data, we dont have dirty reads.

    e.x

    -- Local Instance 1
    USE sql_store;
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
    SELECT points
    FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id = 1;



    -- Local Instance 2 
    USE sql_store;
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE customers
    SET points = 20
    WHERE customer_id = 1;
    ROLLBACK;


    -- Simulate
    - If we run Local Instance 2 but we dont commit(Before COMMITT or ROLLBACK)
    - then if we run 1st transaction we see the original data of the table until we commit it.


    So we dont have Dirty reads => But we have Unrepeatable reads:
    Is possible during a transaction we need to read something twice, but we get different values each time.

    e.x

    -- Local Instance 1
    USE sql_store;
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
    START TRANSACTION;
    SELECT points FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
    SELECT points FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
    COMMIT;



    -- Local Instance 2 
    USE sql_store;
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE customers
    SET points = 20
    WHERE customer_id = 1;
    ROLLBACK;

    -- Simulate
    - If we run Local Instance 2 and commit the transaction => we have 20 points
    - then if we run 1st transaction but only the 1st SELECT statement, we see we have 20 points
    - then if we run Local Instance 2 and commit the transaction with new points => 30 points
    - finally we run the 1st transaction but now the 2nd SELECT statement, we see that we have 30 points

    So we have inconsistence reads, because we are SELECT the same data but we have different values.
    To solve this problem we need to increase the Isolation Level for the 1st Transaction.
