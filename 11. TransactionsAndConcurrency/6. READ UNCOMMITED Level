READ UNCOMMITED Transaction Isolation Level
    We will able to read uncommited data, so we are gonna have dirty reads.


    e.x

    -- Local Instance 1
    USE sql_store;
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
    SELECT points                                    => Here we dont have START TRANSACTION(autocommit MySQL)
    FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id = 1;
    

    -- Local Instance 2
    USE sql_store;
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE customers
    SET points = 20
    WHERE customer_id = 1;
    COMMIT;



    -- Simulation
    - Initially customer with id=1 has 2273 points
    - If session2 run till the UPDATE statement (before COMMIT)
    - then session1 we run => We have 20 points 
                              now in the 2nd transaction instead of COMMIT is ROLLBACK or maybe the server crashed
                              in the 1st transaction we're still working with a value that never existed.

    Note: With this Level we may experience all concurrency problems
