Viewing Privileges
    To see the permissions/Privileges assigned to a user account.
    Two ways to do this:

    1. Using SQL
       
       Syntax:
            SHOW GRANTS;                            => See permissions for the current users
            SHOW GRANTS FOR username@hostname;

       ex. See all the privileges/grants for john
            SHOW GRANTS FOR john;
            -- we will see:
            - GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE data
            - SHUTDOWN the server
            - BACKUP_ADMIN for creating backups

    2. Navigator panel


        Click on Administration tab(left side)
            Click on Users and Privileges
                Select one user
                    Click on Administrative Roles(right side)
                        We can see:
                        - Roles 
                        - Privileges assigned

                    Click on Schema Privileges
                        We can see:
                        - Specific permissions for various databases
                          this is onyl for users account that doesn't have ALL privileges
                          so we see the 'only databases access' that this user has acces to.
                        - Click on the database(schema) and if we want to make neccesary 
                          changes by selecting/unselecting below and then Apply!!
