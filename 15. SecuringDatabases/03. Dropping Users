Dropping Users
    We need to drop the user account as people leave of the organization, so they can not longer access
    to our MySQL server.

    Syntax:
        DROP USER username@hostname;

    e.x Create a new user connect form codewithmosh.com and set a simple password and then remove the bob user
        CREATE USER bob@codewithmosh.com IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
        
        DROP USER bob@codewithmosh.com;
