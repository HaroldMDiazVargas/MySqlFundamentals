Granting Privileges
    Once we create the user account, we should assign some privileges.
    Head over mysql privigeles => MySQL Reference Manual to see all privileges supported by MySQL.
     - ALL => is the highest level of privigeles we can give to someone. This is typical for admins




    There're two common scenarious:

    1. Where we have a web/desktop app, and we want to allow this app to:
       - read data from our database
       - write data to our database
      But nothing more => Not allow to create new table, modify existing ones(remove columns), so on. 

        Syntax:
            CREATE USER appName_app@hostname IDENTIFIED 'password';   => create user if not exists!

            GRANT privileges
            ON database.tableName   
            TO appName_app@hostname;

            -- privileges can be:
                SELECT records
                INSERT new records
                UPDATE records
                DELETE records
                EXECUTE (execute Stored Procedures)
    
      e.x Imagine we have an app called 'moon' and this app needs to read and write data in the SQL store database

        CREATE USER moon_app IDENTIFIED BY '1234';           => create an user account for this app not for a human
        
        GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE        => these are the tipycal privileges we want to give user account for an app  
        ON sql_store.*                                       => this means all tables in the database
        TO moon_app;                                          => specify the user account


        -- Connect to our server using this user account:
            - create a new connection
              - Connection Name: moon_app_connection
              - Username: moon_app
              - Password: 1234
              Test Connection and OK!!
            
            - Query:
              USE sql_store;
              SELECT * FROM customers;          => this works!
              
              USE sql_blog;
              SELECT * FROM customers;          => ERROR! not access to this database for this user account
            


    2. For our admin/s.
       Someone join to our organization and we give him admin privileges over 1 or more databases, perhaps 
       the entire MySQL server.
        
        Syntax:
            CREATE USER ...

            GRANT privileges
            ON database.tableName 
            TO userName@hostname;

            -- privigeles are gonna be more than reading and writing data:
                create tables
                create triggers
                modify existing tables
                ALL 



        e.x Let's imagine john is gonna be an admin and give admin privileges on all tables of all
            databases

            GRANT ALL 
            ON *.*
            TO john;
