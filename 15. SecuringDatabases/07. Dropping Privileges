Dropping/Revoking privileges
    We may realize we made a mistake granting privileges.


    e.x Revoke to moon_app account the privilege to create views

        REVOKE CREATE VIEW
        ON sql_store.*
        FROM moon_app;

    Notes:
        Always grant the neccesary(minimal) privileges for any user account. Otherwise we open so many 
        security host in our system.
