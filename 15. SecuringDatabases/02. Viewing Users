Viewing Users
    See the list of users in our MySQL server. There're two ways to do this:

    1. Using SQL: we have a database called 'mysql' and in this database we have a table called 'user'
        SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
        -we will see:
        - Host: Represents where the user can connect from
                e.g % means wildcard character just like we use the LIKE operator, this means connect from 
                    anywhere, not restrictions.
        - User: Represents the username accounts
                e.g mysql.infoschema, mysql.session, mysql.sys are user accounts used by MySQL internally
                    root is the user account we created when we installed MySQL.
                    All these accounts mentioned their host is 'localhost', this means if we want to log in 
                    as the root => we have to be in this computer => Not allow connect remotely and log in 
                    as the root user.
        - Select_priv:
        - Insert_priv:
        - Update_priv:
        - Delete_priv:
        ..
        ..
        - Show_db_priv:
        All these columns determinates the permission for each user

    2. We can also see the users in the navigator panel:
        Click on Administration tab on left side:
            Click on Users and Privileges
                See the User and Host for each user account
