Changing Passwords
    People can forget passwords, so as admin we could change the users passwords or even our own password.
    There're two ways to do this:

    1. Using SQL: use the SET PASSWORD statement:


        e.x change the password of john user to a new password
            SET PASSWORD FOR john = '1234';
            
        e.x change our own password to a new password
            SET PASSWORD = '1234';      => Change for the currently logged user wether is root user or someone else.

    2. Using the Navigator Panel:
        Click on Administration Panel(left-side)
            Click on Users and Privileges
                Click over one user
                    Here we can:
                    - change passwords
                    - expire the password: Force to user change the password next time they log in

                        Finally click to Apply!
