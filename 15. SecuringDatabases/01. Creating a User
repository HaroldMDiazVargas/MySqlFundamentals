Securing Databases
    We've been used MySQL in our own computer, so we didn't worry about security in terms on:
    - who can access to our data
    - how much access they should have

    In a real world, we typically have database somewhere in a server, if we dont take security seriously 
    people can access to our data.


Creating a User
    We've connected to our database server using the root User, this is the same user account we created at 
    time we installed MySQL. 
    When we use MySQL in a production environment, we need to create additional user accoounts and give them 
    specific privileges.

    e.g. we're building a web or desktop app, our app needs to access data in a MySQL database, so we need to 
         create a User account for our app and give it permission to:
         - read data
         - write data to our app database
         But nothing more!
         So the User account shouldn't be able to change the Structure of our database:
         - Not allow to create new tables
         - Not allow to drop existing tables
         
    e.g Someone in our job enters as Database Admin, we need to create an account for this person, so they can 
        manage:
        - one or more databases
        - the entire MySQL server

    Create a new user account in MySQL:
     We use the CREATE USER statement, and we can optionally restrict where the user can connect from using @.
     Syntax:
        CREATE USER username                => we can just let user to connect from anywhere(no restrictions)
        CREATE USER username@ipAddress      => we can specify the ip address
        CREATE USER username@hostName       => we can specify a host name
        CREATE USER username@domainName     => we can also specify a domain name
        CREATE USER username@'%.domainName'  => we can also specify a domain name and its subdomains(use quotes)
        After the CREATE USER ...:
        IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

     e.x create john user and restrict to our own computer(our ip address computer)
        CREATE USER john@127.0.0.1 
        CREATE USER john@localhost
        -- This means this user can only connect to the same computer where we've installed MySQL. If they try
           to connect from a different computer => MySQL declines the connection
    
     This is very useful in Cloud Environments: Typically we have:
     - Web Server: 
     - Database Server: When creating a new user account for our app, we want to make sure that the user account 
                        can only connect from the Web Server. This is where we specify the IP adress of the Web Server

     e.x create john user and restrict to connect from codewithmosh.com domain
        CREATE USER john@codewithmosh.com
        -- This means the user can connect from ANY computer but in this domain, and not in subdomains of 
           codewithmosh.com. 

     e.x create john user and restrict to connect from codewithmosh.com and all its subdomains 
        CREATE USER john@'%.codewithmosh.com'

-- Query 
CREATE USER john IDENTIFIED BY '1234'
