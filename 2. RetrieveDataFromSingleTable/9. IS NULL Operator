IS NULL Operator
    Look for records that miss an attribute. NULL means the absense of a value.

    e.x we may have customer that doesnt have phone number (NULL value). Get customers who dont have a phone
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE phone IS NULL

    e.x get customers who have a phone
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE phone IS NOT NULL
