BETWEEN Operator
    Compare an attribute with a range of values. Make code shorter and cleaner

    e.x get customers who have more than 1000 and less than 3000 points

        USE sql_store;
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE points >= 1000 AND points <= 3000

        USE sql_store;
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000

    This range values using BETWEEN are inclusive.(>= , <=)



-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000



Exercise. Query return customers born between 1/1/1990 and 1/1/2000

-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-01-01'
