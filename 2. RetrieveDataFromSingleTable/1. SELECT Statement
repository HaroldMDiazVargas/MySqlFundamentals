Retrieve data from a single table

Note: SQL is not a case sensitive language. Best practice use capitalize for SQL keywords
Steps 
    1. Select a database for query to get data from a database: select one database(bold)
        the query we will write will be executed against that database
        USE sql_store
    2. SELECT statement basic structure:
        SELECT columnToRetrieve, columnToRetrieve, * (Retrieve all columns)
        FROM clause: where we specify a table that we want to query
        e.x select all customers in a given table
            USE sql_store;
            SELECT *
            FROM customers
        When we have multiple SQL statements, we need to terminate each statement using a semicolon
    
    There're other filters we can use to sort and select data.
        WHERE clause: filter the result and get the customer with id=1
        e.x
            WHERE customer_id = 1
        ORDER BY clause: we specify the columns we want to sort the result on
        e.x 
            ORDER BY first_name

    These 3 clauses:
        FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY are optional
        But in real world we quite often used all of them
        The order pf these clauses matters:
            Always we have SELECT
                           FROM
                           WHERE
                           ORDER BY
        We can not change the order of these clauses. Otherwise we get a syntax error
    
    Tecnhically we put each clause in new line, but whitespaces, tabs and linebreaks are ignored when executed
    SQL statements. But if as our qurys get more complex is better to put each clause in new line


-- Query  
    
USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY first_name
