The AND, OR and NOT operators

Combine multiple search conditions when filter data

Using WHERE clause:
    AND operator => Both conditions should be true
        e.x filter all customer born after given year and have more than 1000 points
            SELECT *
            FROM customers
            WHERE birth_date > '2022-01-01' AND points > 1000
        
    OR operator => If at least one of the conditions is true, that row will retrieve in the result set
    
    Combine multiple logical operators, is better to be aware. 
        AND => Always evaluated first
        But we can change the order using parenthesis and make the code cleaner
    
    NOT operator => negate the condition
        e.x customers born before 1990 and have less than 1000 points 
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000)
            this is equal to:
        WHERE birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000 => Remove NOT operator and negate all operators


-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR 
	(points > 1000  AND state = 'VA')


Exercise. From order_items table. Get items form order#6 and where total price is greather than 30

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM order_items
WHERE  order_id = 6 AND unit_price*quantity > 30
