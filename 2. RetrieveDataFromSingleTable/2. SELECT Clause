SELECT clause in detail

With the SELECT clause we can do:
    * we can select all the columns in a table
    specify columns that we want. Very useful with table with many columns and perhaps millions records
        e.x SELECT first_name, last_name
            SELECT last_name, first_name => last_name columns comes first
            SELECT last_name, first_name, points
            FROM customers
        e.x we want to get the points a put in a math formula to calculate the discount we can give to each customers
            SELECT last_name, first_name, points + 10 => This is a math expression
            FROM customers

            SELECT last_name, first_name, points, points+10
            FROM customers
        We have:
            + operator: for addition
            *
            /
            -
            %
        e.x
            SELECT
                last_name,
                first_name,
                points,
                points * 10 + 100   => the name of the column will be this expression
            FROM customers
        We can give to a column an alias(name) using the AS keyword.
        e.x
            SELECT
                last_name,
                first_name,
                points,
                (points + 10) * 100 AS discount_factor (or use "discount factor" to allow space)
            FROM customers  
    
    We can select unique values of a given column(remove duplicates). For this we use the DISTINCT keywork
        e.x
            SELECT DISTINCT state
            FROM customers
        with this query we retrieve the unique list of state of customers table.

-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT 
	last_name,
    first_name,
    points,
    (points + 10) * 100 AS "discount factor"
FROM customers



Exercise. Retrieve all the products in a database.
        Result set should have 3 columns: name, unit price, new price(unit price * 1.1)

-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT 
    name,
    unit_price,
    unit_price * 1.1 AS "new price"
FROM products
