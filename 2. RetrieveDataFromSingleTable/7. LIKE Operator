LIKE Operator
    Retrieve rows/records that match a specific String Pattern.
    % any number of characters
    _ single character

    Note: This LIKE operator in MySQL is a older operator. We have a new one more powerful and allows use
          to search for any String Pattern

    e.x get customers whose last name start with 'b'

        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%' => Doesn't matter is lower/upper case 'b'
    
    We use the % assign to indicate any number of characters(not char, 1, or whatever).
    This % assign can be anywhere place.

    e.x get customers have 'b' in the last name

        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE last_name LIKE '%b%'

    e.x get customers whose last name end with 'y'
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE last_name LIKE '%y'


    We also have underscore '_', this matches a single character. 

    e.x get customers whose last name end with 'y' and has exactly 2 characters long 
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE last_name LIKE '_y'
    
    e.x get customers whose last name start with 'b' then we have exactly 4 characters and ends with 'y'
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE last_name LIKE 'b____y'


-- Query


USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'b____y'



Exercise. Query to get the customers whose addresses contain TRAIL or AVENUE
          Query to get customers whose phone numbers not end with 9

-- Query 1

USE sql_store;
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE address LIKE '%TRAIL%'  OR
     address LIKE '%AVENUE%'


-- Query 2

USE sql_store;
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE phone NOT LIKE '%9'
