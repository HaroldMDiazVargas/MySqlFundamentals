IN Operator => Used where we want to compare an attribute with a list of values
    Instead of combining multiple conditions using OR operator. We can use IN operator
    Syntax:
        WHERE column IN (AllValues)
        the order of the values doesnot matter


    e.x customers that are located in Virginia OR Florida OR Georgia
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE state = 'VA' OR state = 'GA' OR state = 'FL'

        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE state IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')


    We can also use the NOT operator with IN operator
    e.x customers are located outside of Virginia AND Florida AND Georgia
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        WHERE state NOT IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')


-- Query
USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state NOT IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')



Exercise. Query to get products where quantity in stock equal to one of the values: 49, 38, 72


USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE quantity_in_stock IN (49,38,72)
