WHERE clause in SQL

We use WHERE clause to filter data:
    Filter by a given condition.
    The query execution engine in MySQL is going to iterate over all the customers in the customer table
    and for each customer is going to evaluate the condition. If condition is true will retrieve customer in
    result set.
        e.x filter customers with points > 3000
            SELECT *
            FROM customers
            WHERE points > 3000
    List of comparison operators:
        > greater than
        >= greater than or equal to
        < less than
        <= less than or equal to
        = equality operator
        != or <> no equality operators

        e.x get all customers from state of Virginia
            SELECT *
            FROM customers
            WHERE state = 'VA' => sequence of chars(string need quotes can be single or double quotes)
                               => this also can be  'va' doesnt matter lower/upper case
        
        e.x get all customers outside of state of Virginia
            SELECT
            FROM customers
            WHERE state  <> 'va'
        
        e.x get all customers born after January 1st 1990. We use quotes for date values
            default format for representing dates in MySQL: yyyy-mm-dd
            SELECT 
            FROM customers
            WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01'




-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state = 'VA'
        



Exercise. Get the orders placed this year

-- Query
USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_data >= '20222-01-01'
