LIMIT Clause
    limit the number of records returned from our query. 
    if argument we pass is greater than number of records => we will get all records in our query result
    we can pass an offset => useful when we want to paginate the data => LIMIT x,y
                             tells to MySQL skip x of records and then pick y records


    e.x get only the first 3 records of customers table
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        LIMIT 3

    e.x imagine a webpage for user to see al customers in the database. imagine show only 3 customers per page
        page 1: customers 1 to 3, page 2: customers 4 to 6 and page 3: customers 7 to 9
        SELECT *
        FROM customers
        LIMIT 6, 3  => this represent the page 3 of the webpage




Exercise. Get the top 3 loyal customers, these are the customers who have more points than everyone else

-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY points DESC
LIMIT 3
