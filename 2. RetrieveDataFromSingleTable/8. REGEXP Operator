REGEXP Operator (Regular Expression)
    Search for row that match String Patten. Are extemely powerful when it comes to searching strings.
    Allow to search more complex String Patterns.
    
    In REGEXP we have additional characters that we dont have whe we use the LIKE operator.
    We can use:
        ^ indicate the begining of a string
        $ represent the end of a string
        | (pipe) represent multiple search patterns (logical or)
        []  combinate various string patterns
        [x-y] range of characters
        MySQL supports more special characters. But these 5 are the most we use 90% of time


    e.x search for customers who have the word 'field' in the last name
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%field%'

    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field' => Not need '%' 
    
    e.x get customers that last name must start with 'field'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP '^field'

    e.x get customers that last name must end with 'field'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field$'

    e.x get customer that last name contains 'field' or 'mac' or 'rose'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field|mac|rose'

    e.x get customers that last name start with 'field' or should have 'mac' or should have 'rose'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP '^field|mac|rose'

    e.x search customers who have an 'e' in the last_name and before this 'e' we either have a 'g' or 'i' or 'm'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e'  => ge ie me

    e.x search customers who have an 'e' in the last_name and after this 'e' we either have 'f' or 'm' or 'q'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'e[fmq]' => ef em eq

    e.x searh customers who have an 'e in the last name and before this 'e' we either have characters from 'a' to 'h'
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e' => equal to [abcdefgh]e (this is very verbose)



-- Query
USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e'

Exercise. Get customers who
        first names are ELKA or AMBUR
        last names end with EY or ON
        last names start with MY or contains SE
        last names contain B followed by R or U


-- Query

USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name REGEXP 'elka|ambur'
-------------------------------------
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'ey$|on$'
-------------------------------------
WHERE last_name REGEXP '^my|se'
-------------------------------------
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'b[ru]'
