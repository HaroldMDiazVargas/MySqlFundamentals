Date Functions
    Useful function to work with dates and times.
        NOW() => get current date and time on the current machine
        CURDATE() => get current date without time component7
        CURTIME() => get current time
        YEAR(dateOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract year, we need to pass NOW() or any date function
        MONTH(dateOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current month as numeric e.g 11
        MONTHNAME(dateOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current month as string e.g November
        DAY(dayOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current day as numeric e.g 31
        DAYNAME(dayOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current day as a string e.g Monday
        HOUR(dayOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current hour
        MINUTE(dayOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current minute
        SECOND(dayOrTimeFunction or just a date) => extract the current second

    Apart of these functions we also have the EXTRACT functions, to able put our code to other DBMS 
    because is part of standard SQL code.
        EXTRACT(unit FROM dateOrTimeFunction or just a date) => we can extract the 'unit', the unit can be:
