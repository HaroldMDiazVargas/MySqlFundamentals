The IF function
    Test a condition and return different values depending on => if the condition is true or not.
    Syntax:
        IF(expression, firstValue, secondValue) => if the expression is valid, will return firstValue.
                                                   Otherwise will return the secondValue these values can be 
                                                   anything(number, string, date, etc)

    e.x classify orders into 2 categories => active and archived, if the order is placed in the current year
        we want to put it in the active category, otherwise in the archived. 
        We used this using UNION operator writing 2 statements
    
        SELECT 
            order_id,
            order_date,
            IF(
                YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()), 
                'Active', 
                'Archived') AS category
        FROM orders

Exercise. Query to have => product_id, 
                           name, 
                           orders => number of times each product has been ordered 
                           frequency => based of what we have in orders column
                                        if orders > 1 => Many times
                                        otherwise => Once

-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    IF ( COUNT(*) > 1, 'Many times', 'Once') AS frequency
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi
    USING(product_id)
GROUP BY product_id
