The IFNULL and COALESCE Functions
    Couple more useful functions in MySQL.
    - IFNULL(column, stringLabel) => sustitute the NULL values of a column for something else
    - COALESCE(column1, column2, stringLabel ) => more flexible function. Sustitute NULL values of a column
                                                  for a value of other column, and at the same time if not, for
                                                  a string label

    e.x. display label 'Not assigned' to the user for shipper_id for these orders that has shipper_id is NULL
        SELECT
            order_id,
            IFNULL(shipper_id, 'Not assigned') AS shipper
        FROM orders

    e.x display the value of the comments column if shipper_id is null. and if comments is also null return 'Not assigned'
        SELECT
            order_id,
            COALESCE(shipper_id, comments, 'Not assigned')
        FROM orders
    
Exercise. In store database, write a query with customer and phone columns. In customer column display
          full name and in the phone display phone number, but if is null display  'Unknown'

-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name) AS customer,
    COALESCE(phone, 'Unknown') AS phone
FROM customers
