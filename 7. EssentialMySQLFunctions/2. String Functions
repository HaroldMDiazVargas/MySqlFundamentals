String Functions
    Most useful functions to work with the string values:
        LENGTH(string) => number of characters of the string
        UPPER(string) => convert to uppercase 
        LOWER(string) => convert to lowercase
        LTRIM(string) => left trim, so we remove spaces from left
        RTRIM(string) => right trim, so we remove extra spaces from right
        TRIM(string) => remove any extra spaces in both sides
        LEFT(string, amount) => return the first amount of characters of the string
        RIGHT(string, amount) => return the last amount of characters of the string
        SUBSTRING(string, startPos, length) => return characters from anywhere in the string(index starts in 1)
                                            => length argument is optional, so it takes froms startPost to last character
        LOCATE(searchString, string) => return the first position of the 1st ocurrence of a character or sequence of characters    
                                     => searchCharacter or searchString is not case sensitive, so can be upper or lowercase
                                     => we get 0 if the searchString doesnot exist.
        REPLACE(string, replace?, with? ) => replace a character or a squence of characters
                                          => pass what we want to replace and with what.
        CONCAT(string1, string2) => concatenate strings into a final string
        CONCAT(string1, string2, string3,...)

        Note: All string must be in quotes.
