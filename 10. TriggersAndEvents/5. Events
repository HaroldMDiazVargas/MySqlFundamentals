Events in MySQL
    Event is a task or block of SQL code that gets executed according to a schedule. 
    It can get execute: - once
                        - in a regular basis like everyday at 10a.m, once at month, so on

    With events we can automated database maintaining taks such as:
        - deleting state data
        - copy data from one table into an archived table
        - aggregating data to generating reports.

    Event Convention Name:
        interval_action_of_the_event          => interval can be hourly, monthly, yearly, month, so on.
        

    Steps:
        1. Turn on MySQL Event Schedule => process than runs in a background, constantly looks for events to execute
            SHOW VARIABLES; => we can see all system variables of MySQL
            SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event%'; => see only variables whose name start with 'event'
                Result Grid we can see => event_scheduler set to ON

            SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON/OFF => if we dont use events turn off to save system resources
        
        2. Syntax:

            DELIMITER $$

            CREATE EVENT eventName     
            ON SCHEDULE                                                                          => provide a schedule for this event(how often) 
                AT 'dateTimeValue'                                                               => execute once e.g AT '2022-01-01'
                EVERY value partOfDateTimeValue STARTS 'dateTimeValue' ENDS 'dateTimeValue'      => execute more than once e.g EVERY 1 HOUR
                                                                                                    STARTS and ENDS are optional
            DO BEGIN
                SQL code                                                                          => Body of Event
            END $$

            DELIMITER ;



    e.x Create an event that every year delete audit records that are 1 year older.

        CREATE EVENT yearly_delete_state_audit_rows
        ON SCHEDULE
            EVERY 1 YEAR START '2022-01-01' ENDS '2029-01-01'
        DO BEGIN
            DELETE FROM payments_audit
            WHERE action_date < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR;            => Substract 1 year from the current year
        END $$

        DELIMITER ;

git 
        Notes:
            - NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR is equivalent to using DATESUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) function  
                                                             DATEADD(NOW(), INTERVAL -1 YEAR)
