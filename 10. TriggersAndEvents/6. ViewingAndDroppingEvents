Viewing and Dropping Events
    View, drop or alter our events:
        - View event in current database => use SHOW EVENTS statement
                                            e.g SHOW EVENTS;
                                         => we can see all events and their characteristics
                                         => we can easily use LIKE operator to filter because the name convention
                                            e.g SHOW EVENTS LIKE 'yearly%'; => see events get triggered every year

        - Drop an event => use DROP EVENT IF EXISTS statement
                            e.g DROP EVENT IF EXISTS yearly_delete_stale_audit_rows;
        
        - Alter an event to make changes without need to drop and recreate it.
          We use ALTER EVENT statement => we can change schedule, SQL statement that will be executed
            e.g     
            DELIMITER $$ 

            ALTER EVENT yearly_delete_state_audit_rows
            ON SCHEDULE
                EVERY 1 YEAR START '2022-01-01' ENDS '2029-01-01'  => as we have ALTER EVENT statement, we can change the schedule
            DO BEGIN
                DELETE FROM payments_audit
                WHERE action_date < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR;           
            END $$

            DELIMITER ;


          We also use the ALTER EVENT statement => to temporary Enable or Disable an event

            ALTER EVENT eventName DISABLE/ENABLE;
