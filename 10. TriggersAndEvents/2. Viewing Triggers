Viewing Triggers
    We have created a couple of triggers so far, but unfortunaly in MySQL workbench there's not way to 
    visualize the Triggers we have created.
    
    We only can see => Tables, Views, Stored Procedures and Functions.

    But we can use SHOW TRIGGERS statement to look all the Triggers in the current database:
        We can see various attributes about the trigger:
        - Tirgger name
        - Event (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
        - Table 
        - Statement (code for the trigger)
        - Timing (BEFORE or AFTER)
        - Creation datetime of the trigger

        We can filter the result of this info using LIKE operator:
            - LIKE 'patternString'
        So if we have a name convention, with this operator we can easily find a trigger associated with a given
        table.



        e.x See triggers associated to the payments table

            SHOW TRIGGERS LIKE 'payments%'
