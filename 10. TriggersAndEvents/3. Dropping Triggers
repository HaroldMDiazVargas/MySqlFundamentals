Dropping Triggers
    Very similar to dropping Stored Procedures

    Syntax:
        DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS triggerName;  => IF EXISTS optionally but preffered

    Note: We should DROP and CREATE TRIGGER statements in one SQL file that is also check in source control
          repository =>So not only can everyone in the team create the same database in their machine, but over
          time we can view the history of changes to our database.


    Syntax:
        DELIMITER $$

        DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS triggerName;

        CREATE TRIGGER triggerName
            AFTER/BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ON tableName
            FOR EACH ROW                

        BEGIN
                           
            ...
                NEW/OLD.attribute         
            ...;

        END $$

        DELIMITER ;
