Implicit Join Syntax
    Another way to write a simple join between 2 tables. Syntax:
    FROM selectMultipleTables => table1, table2
    WHERE baseJoinCondition => table1.id = table2.id
    Note: Not very suggest to use even this is supported in MySQL. Because if we forget WHERE clause  we will get
          a cross join(every record in table1 is join with every record in table2).
          Better use JOIN syntax, because forces us to use the baseJoinCondition.

    e.x join orders tables with customers table
        SELECT *
        FROM orders o
        JOIN customers c
            ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        
        -- Implicit Join Syntax
        SELECT *
        FROM orders o, customers c
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
