Joining Multiple Tables
    Join more than 2 tables in a query.

    e.x Join 3 tables => orders with customers(customer_id) to get the info about the customer(first and last name)
                        and with order_statuses to get the name of the status(processed,shipped, delivered)
        SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.first_name, c.last_name, os.name AS status
        FROM orders o
        JOIN customers c
            ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        JOIN order_statuses os
            ON o.status = os.order_status_id

    


Exercise. In sql_invoicing database, join the payments table with payment_methods table and as well with the
         clients table
    
-- Query

USE sql_invoicing;
SELECT p.invoice_id, p.date, p.amount, c.name, pm.name AS payment_method
FROM payments p
JOIN clients c
    ON p.client_id = c.client_id
JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
