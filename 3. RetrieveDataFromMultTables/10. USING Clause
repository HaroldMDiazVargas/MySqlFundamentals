The USING Clause
    As our query get more complex, the joinConditions get in the way making our query hard to read.
    In MySQL we have this power feature to simplify these querys.
    If our column name used in joinCondition across the 2 tables, we can replace the ON clause with USING clause
    syntax:
        USING (columnName)
        USING (column1Name, column2Name) => CompundJoinConditions

    e.x join orders tables with customers table. And also join with the shippers table
        SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name, sh.name AS shipper
        FROM orders o
        JOIN customers c
            USING (customer_id)
        LEFT JOIN shippers sh
            USING (shipper_id)

    e.x join order_items table with order_item_notes table, where there're 2 columns that unique identify(keys)
        each record(CompundJoinConditions)
        SELECT 
        FROM order_items oi
        JOIN order_item_notes oin
            USING (order_id, product_id)


Exercise. get a query with date, client, amount and name of payment method. For this
          use sql_invoicing database.
    
USE sql_invoicing;
SELECT p.date, c.name AS client, p.amount, pm.name 
FROM payments p
JOIN clients c
    USING(client_id)
JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
