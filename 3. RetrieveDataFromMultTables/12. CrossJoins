Cross Joins
    We use to combine or join every record of the 1st table with every record of the 2nd table.
    So we dont have a joinCondition
    explicit syntax:
        CROSS JOIN tableToCrossJoin  => more clear
    implicit syntax:
        FROM table1, table2 => we put multiple tables in the FROM clause
    
    Real example to use this => when we have a table of sizes(small, medium and large) and table of colors(blue, green, etc)
                                then we want to combine all the sizes with all the colors.

    e.x Cross join customers table with products table. Every record in customers table will be combine with
        every record in the products table. This in order to have name of every customer in combinatio with
        the different products.
        SELECT c.first_name AS customer, p.name AS product
        FROM customers c
        CROSS JOIN products p
        ORDER BY c.first_name

    e.x Use now the implicit syntax
        SELECT c.first_name AS customer, p.name AS product
        FROM customers c, orders o
        ORDER BY c.first_name


Exercise. Cross join between shippers table and products table using both syntax

-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT p.name AS product, sh.name AS shipper
FROM shippers sh
CROSS JOIN products p
ORDER BY p.name

USE sql_store;
SELECT p.name AS product, sh.name AS shipper
FROM shippers sh, products p
ORDER BY p.name
