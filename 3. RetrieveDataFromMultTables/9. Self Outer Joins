Self Outer Joins
    Join a tables with itself, where a column has a relationship with another column of the same table.


    e.x employees table(from sql_hr) we can get all the employees and their manager.
        SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, m.first_name AS manager
        FROM employees e
        JOIN employees m
            ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id

    but we want to return all th employees wheter they have a manager or not.

        SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, m.first_name AS manager
        FROM employees e
        LEFT JOIN employees m
            ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
