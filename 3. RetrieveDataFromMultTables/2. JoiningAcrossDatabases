Joining Across Databases
    Real world when we work as developer or database admin, we work with multiple databases.
    Combine columns from tables across multiple databases. 
    We can prefix table with the name of database that are not part of the current database
    

    e.x sql_store database has a products table exactly to the product table of sql_inventory database
        this is not a good design. 
        Join the order_items table(from sql_store) with products table(from sql_inventory)
        SELECT *
        FROM order_items oi
        JOIN sql_inventory.products p
            ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
    
    e.x select the sql_inventory(USE keyword) and make the same join
        USE sql_inventory;
        SELECT *
        FROM sql_store.order_items oi
        JOIN products p
            ON oi.product_id = -product_id
    

        
-- Query

USE sql_store;
FROM order_items oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products p
    ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
