Compound Join Conditions
    We have used a single column to unique identify the rows in a given table(e.x customer_id).
    But we may have a table with different columns and none of these columns have unique identify 
    the values are repeated, so we can not use a column to unique identify the records.
    So we can use the combination of 2 columns to unique identify, but we have to be sure that we dont have
    2 records that have the same combination, this combination must be UNIQUE(according to the problem context)
    If we open a table like this in design mode, we can see that yellow key(primary key) exist on both columns
    this is called a Composite Primary Key.

    e.x join order_items tables with order_items_notes table. This join based on 2 columns
        SELECT *
        FROM order_items oi
        JOIN order_items_notes oin
            ON oi.order_id = oin_order_id 
            AND oi.product_id = oin.product_id
