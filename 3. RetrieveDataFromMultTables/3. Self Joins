Self Joins
    We can join a table with itself
    We need to define different Alias for different table, even it is the same table
    
    e.x Query to join employees tablle(from sql_hr) with itself. To select the name of each emloyee and their manager
        USE sql_hr;
        SELECT *
        FROM employees e
        JOIN employees m => m means manager
            ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
    
    e.x simplify the last query to have the name of the employee and their manager
        USE sql_hr;
        SELECT SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, m.first_name AS manager
        FROM employees e
        JOIN employees m => m means manager
            ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
