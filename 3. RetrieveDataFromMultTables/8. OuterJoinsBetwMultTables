Outer Joins Between Multiple Tables
    Join more than 2 tables using outer join.

    Note: Avoid using RIGHT JOIN, because when join multiple tables, and we use RIGHT and LEFT JOINS the things
          get really complex.

    e.x query to join customers table with orders table to get all customers wether they have ordered or not.
        and  with shippers table to display the name of the shipper, to return all orders wheter they have 
        shipper or not.


        SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, sh.name AS shipper
        FROM customers c
        LEFT JOIN orders o
            ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
        LEFT JOIN shippers sh
            ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
        ORDER BY c.customer_id



Exercise. Query that produces order_date, order_id, first_name, shipper and status. 

USE sql_store;
SELECT o.order_date, o.order_id, c.first_name AS customer, sh.name AS shipper, os.name AS status
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shippers sh
    ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
LEFT JOIN order_statuses os
    ON o.status = os.order_status_id
ORDER BY status
