Natural Joins
    In MySQL we also have another simpler way to join 2 tables, easier to code
    But this is something not recommend, sometimes produces unexpected results.
    We dont explicitly specify the column names(joinCondition), the database engine will looking at
    the 2 tables, and join them based on the common columns(same name). But is not good to let the database engine
    figured out or guess the join

    e.x Join orders table with customers table.

    SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name
    FROM orders o
    NATURAL JOIN customers c
