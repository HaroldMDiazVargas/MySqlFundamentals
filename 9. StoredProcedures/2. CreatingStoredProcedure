Creating a Stored Procedure
    We use CREATE PROCEDURE statement to create a Stored Procedure. A common convention of MySQL developers
    is to write the name in lowercase separate by '_'. We can use parameters to pass a value to our 
    Stored Procedure. Between BEGIN and END we can hace multiple statements e.g SELECT..FROM...; => we need to
    terminate(delimiter) each statement using a semicolon(;) even if we have a single statement 
                                                        => MySQL requirement(Dont worry e.g SQL Server)
                                                           we dont have to change the default delimiter

    We want to give all the statements to MySQL as a single unit rather than individual statements separated
    by a semicolon => so we want that MySQL take all this as a single unit and create a Stored Procedure for us
                      with the name we chose. We dont want to execute invidivual statements that we have here.
                      => so we need to change the delimiter(;) for something else, for this just before 
                         creating our Stored Procedure we use the DELIMITER statement to change the default 
                         delimiter, by convention a lot of developers use $$, but we can literal use anything
                         e.g //, any sequence of characters we dont use in our SQL code. We need to repeat 
                         the $$ after END keyword.
                         With all this we are telling MySQL => this is the new delimiter, and thake all the 
                         statements as single unit.
                         Finally we need to change the default DELIMITER back to a semicolon(;)
                    


    Syntax:
        DELIMITER $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE storedProcedureName(parameters)
        BEGIN 
            statement1;                => Body of Stored Procedure        
            statement2;             
            ...
        END$$

        DELIMITER ;


    To call/execute the Stored Procedure:
        - We can click over the ray icon 
        - We can use the CALL statement
            syntax:
                CALL storedProecedureName()

    
    Note: Most of the time call a Stored Procedure is something we do in our app code like in C#, java, python, etc
          But there're times we want to call Stored Procedure in our SQL code.


    
    e.x create a new Stored Procedure that get the clients of clients table
        DELIMITE $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE get_clients()
        BEGIN 
            SELECT * FROM clients;
        END$$

        DELIMITER ;

        -- Then in Stored Procedures/ => we just click on the ray icon to call/execute the Stored Procedure

        CALL get_clients()


Exercise. Create a Stored Procedure called get_invoices_with_balance to return all the invoices with a balance > 0

-- Query => We can use our invoice_with_balance view that has a column named balance

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_invoices_with_balance()
BEGIN
    SELECT *
    FROM invoices_with_balance
    WHERE balance > 0;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
