Creating Procedures Using MySQL Workbench
    To avoid change the default DELIMITER every time we want to create a Stored Procedure. So an easier way
    is:
    - right click on the Stored Procedures/ folder
        - create Stored Procedure
            - we just give a name and focus in our SQL statements
                - Then apply => apply => Done!
