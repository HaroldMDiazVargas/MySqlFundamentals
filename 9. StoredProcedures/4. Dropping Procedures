Dropping Stored Procedures
    Useful if we make a mistake and we want to recreate our Stored Procedure
    
    Syntax:
        DROP PROCEDURE storedProcedureName

    If we try to drop a procedure that doesn't exist => get ERROR. To prevent this, we can use the 
    IF EXISTS keyword

    Syntax:
        DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS storedProcedureName

    Also just like views, is a good practice to store the code for dropping and creating a each Stored Procedure
    in a separate SQL file => then put the file under source control/ folder like git. This allow to share
                              our repository to other team members and everyone can recreate this database with
                              all its views and Stored Procedures on their machine.
    
    So, a basic template for dropping and create a Stored Procedure is like:
    Syntax:
        DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS storedProcedureName;

        DELIMITER $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE storedProcedureName(parameters)
        BEGIN 
            statement1;               
            statement2;             
            ...
        END$$

        DELIMITER ;

    -- Then we save this SQL code in stored_procedures/ a file called => get_clients.sql
