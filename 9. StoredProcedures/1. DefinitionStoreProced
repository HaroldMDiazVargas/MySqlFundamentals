What are Stored Procedures


    Let's say we're building an app that has a database. Where we write the SQL statements?
    We will not to write in our app code, for these reasons:
        - It will make our app messy and hard to maintain
            e.g we make an app with C#, java, python => we dont want to mix java code with SQL, because the
                SQL code gets in the way(in the same file) and makes our app messy and hard to maintain-
                Also some language like C# or Java have compilation state, so if we have the SQL in our app code
                we will have to recompile(and potentially redeploy) our app code for any change we make in the 
                SQL code.

    
    So we should take our SQL code out of our app code => store our SQL code in a database where it belongs

    Stored Procedure => is a database object that contains a block of SQL code. In our app code just call this
                        procedure to get or save the data. So we use Stored Procedure to store and organize 
                        our SQL code.

    Benefits:
        - Most other DBMS peform some kind of optimization to the code in Stored Procedures. So the 
          SQL code in Stored Procedure can sometines be executed faster.
        
        - Also, just like views Stored Procedure allows us to enforce Data Security. We can remove 
          the direct access to all the tables and allow various operations like: INSERTING, UPDATING and
          DELETING to be perform by Stored Procedures, then we can decide who can execute which 
          Stored Procedure. This limit what user can do with our data, so we for example can prevent certain 
          user to UPDATE our data
