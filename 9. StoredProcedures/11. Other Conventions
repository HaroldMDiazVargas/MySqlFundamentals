Other Conventions
    Working in different organizations, we realize different people adopte different conventions.
    
    - prefix Function with fn, with or without underline'_'
    - prefix Stored Procedures with proc, with or without underline'_'
    - camel case when naming the functions and Stored Procedures e.g getRiskFactor
    - separate naming using underline '_' e.g get_risk_factor
    - for DELIMITER some people like $$, //
    
    Note: Don't try to invent our own conventions.
