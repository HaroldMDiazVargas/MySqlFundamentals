Inserting Hierarchical Rows
    We have learnt how to insert data into single table. But we can insert data into multiple tables.
    A real example of this is where we have a parent-child relationship, e.g orders table is parent and 
    order_items table is a child, because 1 order we can have multiple order items(multiple products in same order)
    So 1 row in the parent table => can have 1 or more children inside the child table.

    As soon as we insert new row in parent table, MySQL is going to generate an id to the PK column. Then,
    we need to be able to access to that unique id in order to insert the new rows in the child table. Because 
    that PK column is the relationship bewteen these parent-child tables.

    In MySQL we have a bunch of built-in functions, a function is a basically a piece of code that  we can reuse.
    One of this function is LAST_INSERT_ID => we can call this function adding parenthesis and will return ID
    MySQL generate when we insert a new row.

    e.x query to insert an order and all its items, so insert in order table and also in order_items table
        INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, status)
        VALUES (1, '2022-01-02', 1);

        INSERT INTO order_items 
        VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(), 1, 1, 2.95)
        VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(), 2, 1, 3.95)
