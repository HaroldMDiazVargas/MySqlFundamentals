Deleting Rows
    We use the DELETE FROM statement for delete records from a table.
    Optionally we can add search condition(WHERE) to identify the records we want to delete. If we dont use the 
    condition, all the records will be deleted(dangerous)
    Syntax:
        DELETE FROM tableName
        WHERE searchCondition

    We can also use subqueries in the WHERE clause(as search condition)
    
    e.x delete the invoice with id 1 form invoices table.
        DELETE FROM invoices
        WHERE invoice_id = 1
    
    e.x delete all the invoices for the client called 'Myworks'
        DELETE FROM invoices
        WHERE client_id =
                        (SELECT client_id
                         FROM clients
                         WHERE name = 'Myworks' )
