Updating a Single Row
    We use UPDATE statement to update 1 or more records in a table. Then we add SET clause to specify
    the new value for 1 or more columns. Finally we type the condition using WHERE clause, to identify
    the record or records that need updated.
    Syntax:
        UPDATE tableName
        SET columnName = newValue
        WHERE recordCondition


    We can use NULL keyword to insert NULL value to a column that accepts these values
    We can use DEFAULT keyword to let MySQL uses the default values for that column defined in the design mode


    e.x Update at invoices table, the 1st record where there's not payment_date and payment_total is 0.
        This can be due e.g the system that records the payment failed. So we need to update the table
        
        UPDATE invoices
        SET payment_total = 10, payment_date = '2022-03-01'
        WHERE invoice_id = 1

    e.x Restore the original values of the table.
        UPDATE invoices
        SET payment_total = DEFAULT, payment_date = NULL
        WHERE invoice_id = 1
    
    e.x Update the 3rd invoice. Imagine client made 50% on the due_date
        UPDATE invoices
        SET payment_total = invoice_total * 0.5, payment_date = due_date
        WHERE invoice_id = 3
    
    Note: The values are truncated, so when we update we dont see digits after decimal points(for now dont worry)
