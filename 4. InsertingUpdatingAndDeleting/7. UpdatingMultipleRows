Updating Multiple Rows
    The syntax to update multiple records is exactly the same that update single row.
    The condition has to be more general.

    MySQL workbench runs in the safe update mode, so only allows us to update a single record.(Others DBMS allow this)
    On top => MySQL Edit => Preferences => SQL editor => Untick Safe Updated check box.
    Then we need to reconnect to this instance of MySQL => close Local Instance => and reconnect again.

    We can also use the IN operator, to update by a range. An all the operators we use in the WHERE clause also
    apply to this approach. 

    Tecnhically the WHERE clause is optional. If we want update all the records we simply leave it out.

    Syntax:
        UPDATE tableName
        SET columnName = newValue,
            columnName = newValue
        WHERE columnName = valueCondition   (=)  WHERE columnName IN (x,y)

    e.x Update at invoices table, all the invoices for the client_id 3, because we have various invoices
        for the same client.

        UPDATE invoices
        SET payment_total = invoice_total*0.5,
            payment_date = due_date

        WHERE client_id = 3

    e.x Update at invoices table, all the invoices for client_id 3 and 4-
        UPDATE invoices
        SET payment_total = invoice_total*0.5,
            payment_date = due_date

        WHERE client_id IN (3,4)


Exercise. In sql_store db, write a SQL statement to:
            give any customers born before 1990  => 50 extrapoint

USE sql_store;
UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 50
WHERE birth_date < '1990-01-01'
