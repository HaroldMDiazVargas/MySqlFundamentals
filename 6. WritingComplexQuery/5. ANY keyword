The ANY or SOME keyword
    To compare a column value to a multiple values given by a subquery. 
    
    = ANY is equivalent to IN operator

    e.x Select clients with at least 2 invoices

        SELECT *
        FROM clients
        WHERE client_id IN (
                            SELECT
                                client_id
                            FROM invoices
                            GROUP BY client_id
                            HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
        )


    e.x Make the same exercise but using equality operator with ANY
        SELECT *
        FROM clients
        WHERE client_id = ANY (
                            SELECT
                                client_id
                            FROM invoices
                            GROUP BY client_id
                            HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
        )
