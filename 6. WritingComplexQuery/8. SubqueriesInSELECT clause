Subqueries in the SELECT Clause
    We have only used subqueries in the SELECT statement(WHERE clause). But we also can use in the SELECT clause
    Later we can see that we also can use subqueries in the FROM clause

    e.x write a query to have the AVG of all invoices and a colum for the difference between the each invoice
        and the total avg.

        SELECT 
            invoice_id,
            invoice_total,
            (SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
             FROM invoices) AS invoice_average
            invoice_total - (SELECT invoice_average) AS difference
        FROM invoices

        In the last example we:
            - make a subquery for AVG of invoice_total and give an alias to that new column
            - for the last column we could choose between duplicate the previous subquery or convert
              the invoice_average into a subquery using SELECT and parenthesis.
            
Exercise. Query to get the total_sales for each client, the average of all invoices and the difference
          between total_sales and the global avg



USE  sql_invoicing;
SELECT DISTINCT
    client_id,
    name,
    (SELECT SUM(invoice_total)
		 FROM invoices
		 WHERE client_id = c.client_id
		 ) AS total_sales,
    (SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
		FROM invoices) AS average,
     (SELECT total_sales - average) AS difference
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices 
	USING(client_id)
