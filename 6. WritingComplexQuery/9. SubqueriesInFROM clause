Subqueries in the FROM clause
    We can pass subquery in the FROM clause.
    We can see that subquery just like a virtual table that may be we in the future save the subquery, so we 
    treat it like a real table in our database.

    Ever we use a subquery in the FROM clause, is a requirement to give an Alias.
    
    Note: Write a subquery in the FROM clause, can make our main query more complex. 
          A better way to solve this problem is using views.

    e.x pass subquery result of the previous lesson in the FROM clause

        SELECT *
        FROM (
                SELECT 
                client_id,
                name,
                (SELECT SUM(invoice_total)
                    FROM invoices
                    WHERE client_id = c.client_id
                    ) AS total_sales,
                (SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
                    FROM invoices) AS average,
                (SELECT total_sales - average) AS difference
            FROM clients c
        ) AS sales_summary
