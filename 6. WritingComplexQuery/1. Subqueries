Subqueries(Inner query)
    We can write the subqueries in parenthesis. To pass the result to our alter query
    We can write subqueries inside the WHERE clause, in the FROM clause and in the SELECT clause


    e.x Find all the products that are more exprensive than Lettuce( id = 3) in  products table
        SELECT *
        FROM products
        WHERE unit_price > (
                            SELECT unit_price
                            FROM products
                            WHERE product_id = 3
        )

USE sql_hr;
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary

                SELECT AVG(salary)
                FROM employees
