Correlated Subqueries
    Is a subquery where we have a correlation with the outer query. We reference the alias to the outer query.
    If we dont have a reference of the outer query, so MySQL will execute the subquery only once.
    In contrast, we use correlated subqueries, the subquery will execute for each record.

    Sometimes can be slow if we have a lot of data. But are very powerful

    e.x From sql_hr db, select employees whose salary is above the average in their office. Look the office_id col

        SELECT *
        FROM employees
        WHERE salary > (
                        SELECT AVG(salary)
                        FROM employees
                        WHERE office_id = 1
                        GROUP BY office_id

        ) AND office_id = 1

        So we have to write the last query the times that office_id exist. So we make the next thing:
            - we give an alias to outer table 
            - then we pass the column of that table in the WHERE(filter) of the inner query
            With this, SQL will do the next thing:
                - For each employee that iterate will execute the subquery, and will calculate the AVG 
                  salary but only for the office_id corresponding to that employee.

        SELECT *
        FROM employees e
        WHERE salary > (
                        SELECT AVG(salary)
                        FROM employees
                        WHERE office_id = e.office_id
        ) 
    

Exercise. In sql_invoicing db, get the invoices that are larger than the client's average invoice amount

USE sql_invoicing;

SELECT *
FROM invoices i
WHERE invoice_total > (
                    SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
                    FROM invoices
                    WHERE client_id = i.client_id
)
