The ALL keyword
    Compare(>,<,...) with a list of values given in a subquery.
    Prefix the subquery with ALL keyword, but if we dont want to use ALL keyword we can use MAX aggregate function
    Both are the same, just is preference.


    e.x Select invoices that are larger than all invoices of client 3 in our sql_invoicing db. Make this 
        using the standard subquery. So here we use MAX to choose the highest invoice of client 3 as "umbral"
        
        SELECT *
        FROM invoices
        WHERE invoice_total > (
                            SELECT MAX(invoice_total)
                            FROM invoices
                            WHERE client_id = 3
        )

    e.x solve the last example using ALL keyword. In this subquery we dont use MAX so we have a list of values

        SELECT *
        FROM invoices
        WHERE invoice_total > ALL (
                            SELECT invoice_total
                            FROM invoices
                            WHERE client_id = 3
        )
