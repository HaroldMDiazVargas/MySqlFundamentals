The EXISTS Operator
    In our WHERE clause we dont reference a column => instead we use EXISTS operator to see if there's a row
    that matches the criteria in the WHERE clause of the subquery

    We reference the outer query in our subquery(correlated). So for each record MySQL will check if there exists
    a record that matches the criteria of the subquery.

    When we use IN operator => MySQL execute subquery and returns the result to WHERE clause
                                if we have a list returned in our subquery so large, we end negative impact 
                                of performance.
    
    When we use EXISTS operator => Subquery doesnot actually returns a result to the outer query. Instead
                                   return an indication whether any rows of the subquery matches the search condition
                                   As soon as find a record that matches the condition, will return true to the
                                   EXISTS operator and this operator will include the current record in the final result.


    Note: Use EXISTS operator when the return subquery is a list very large.

    e.x query to get the clients that have an invoice

        SELECT *
        FROM clients
        WHERE client_id IN (
                        SELECT DISTINCT client_id
                        FROM invoices
        )

        or using a JOIN

        SELECT DISTINCT client_id, c.name
        FROM clients c 
        JOIN invoices i
            USING(client_id)
    
        or 3rd way to solve this => using EXISTS operator

        SELECT *
        FROM clients c
        WHERE EXISTS (
                    SELECT client_id
                    FROM invoices
                    WHERE client_id = c.client_id 
        )



Exercise. Use sql_store, find the products that have never been ordered

-- Query

USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT *
            FROM order_items
            WHERE product_id = p.product_id
)
