The IN operator
    write a subquery using the IN operator. This operator is used here because our subquery returns a list of values

    e.x In sql_store find the products that have never been ordered
        SELECT *
        FROM products
        WHERE product_id NOT IN (
                            SELECT DISTINCT product_id => get the uniques of products that have been ordered
                            FROM order_items 
        )
        
        
Exercise. In sql_invoicing db write query to find the clients without invoices

-- Query

SELECT *
FROM clients
WHERE client_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices

)
