Integer Types
    We use Integer to store hold numbers that dont have a decimal point. 
    In MySQL we have 5 integer types different in terms of number of bytes used and the range of values they
    can store:
    - TINYINT: takes 1byte  [-128, 127]
    - UNSIGNED TINYINT: store [0, 255] e.g people age
    - SMALLINT: takes 2bytes [-32K, 32K] 
    - MEDIUMINT:takes 3bytes [-8M, 8M]
    - INT: takes 4bytes      [-2B, 2B]
    - BIGINT: takes 8byes [-9Z, 9Z]

    We can mark a column as UNSIGNED(checkbox) to allow only positive numbers and also this prevent 
      accidentally store negative values.

    If we try to store a value outside of the range of column datatype => MySQL throws an error saying
      the value is Out Of Range.

    Numeric types have another attribute called => ZEROFILL
      This is useful in situation where we want a zero pad the values, so they always have the same number of digits
      When defining a Numeric Column we can specify the display size in parenthesis, e.g INT(4) our numbers
      have always 4 digits e.g 0001 (number 1) => This only affect how MySQL display the values not how store them

    Note: Use the smallest data type that suits our needs. Our database will be smaller in size and our queries
          will execute faster. If we are dealing with large amount of data, our queries is going to perform
          better if we use every byte consciously, because these bytes will have to transfer between the disk
          and memory => less data in memory => faster queries !
