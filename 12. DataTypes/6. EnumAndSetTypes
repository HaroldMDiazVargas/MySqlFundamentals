Enum and Set Types
    ENUMS: Restrict the values for a column to limit the list of strings. 
            e.g column called size allow ENUM('small', 'medium', 'large')
           If we add anything else MySQL gives us an error. We can give only the values we specify but 
              can be in lower or uppercase.
    
           Generally are bad and we should avoid:
            - changing the members of an ENUM can be expensive
                e.g rename or adding a new member => MySQL will rebuild entire table(expensive if we have million records)
            - we can't add additional attributes to each member
            - if ww want to display members in a drop-down list is hard word(not easy)
            - ENUMS are not reusable, if we have another table and we want to reuse these values there
              in that table we need to redefine this ENUM with these members(duplication, apply changes in
              multiple places)
    
            A better approach instead of ENUMS is to have a separate table e.g SIZES table 
              we can store all the sizes and all additional attributes they have. We can reuse this table 
              in multiple places, and if we want to get all the sizes we write just a single SELECT statement.
              We refer a table like this => Look Up table. We use quite often these tables to list a 
              drop-down list.

    SET: similar type, but a SET can store mutliple values
         SET(...). Similar to ENUM we specify a list of values and then we can store multiple
         values in a column.

         Again this is really bad => a lot of issues.
