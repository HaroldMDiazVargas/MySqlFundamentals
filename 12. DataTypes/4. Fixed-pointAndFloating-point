Fixed-point and Floating-points Types
    In MySQL we have 3 types for storing numbers with decimal point:
    - DECIMAL(p, s): Useful for storing fixed-point number. These numbers have a fixed number of digits
                     after decimal points e.g monitor values.
                     p(precision): argument to specify the maximun number of digits [1, 64]
                     s(scale): argument that determinates the number of digits after decimal points 
                     
                     e.g DECIMAL(9,2) => 1234567.89 
    
                     This DECIMAL type has few different synonims:
                     - DEC
                     - NUMERIC
                     - FIXED
                     These are exactly the same => stick to DECIMAL and keep consistence
    
    Used in scientific calculations with very large or very small numbers, we should use these types
    These types dont store the exact value, they use an approximation. Thats the reason they allow us
    to store very large or very small values:
        - FLOAT:  takes 4bytes
        - DOUBLE: takes 8bytes
