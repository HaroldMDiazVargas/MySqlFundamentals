Blob Types
    Store large amount of binary data like images, videos, pdf, work files, so on.
    In MySQL we have 4 Blob Types defined based on Maximum of data they can store:
     - TINYBLOB: Store binary data up to 255bytes
     - BLOB: Store binary data up to 65KB
     - MEDIUMBLOB: Store binary data up to 16MB
     - LONGBLOB: Store binary data up to 4GB

     General is better to keep out the files out of our databases, because relational databases are desgined
       for working with Structure Relational Data, not Binary Data.

    Problem with storing files in a database:
        - Our database will inscrease pretty quickly
        - Will slow our backups
        - We experience performance problems, pulling images out of our database is always slower that reading
          them from the file system
        - We will have to write additional code to read/store(write) images in our database.
    
    If we have valid reason for storing our files in our database => Take all these problems into account
    and be sure thes reasons dont apply to our scenario.
