Boolean Types
    Used to store a YES/TRUE or NOT/FALSE kind of values.
    IN MySQL we have 1 datatype called:
    - BOOL
    - BOOLEAN (is the same of BOOL)
    This datatype is really a synonym of TINYINT because:
    - TRUE keyword internally is represented by a 1
    - FALSE is representes as a 0

    e.x 

    UPDATE posts 
    SET is_published = TRUE

    -- Equivalent SQL code:
    
    UPDATE posts 
    SET is_published = 1

    TRUE and FALSE are more descriptive
