String Types
    String category we have a bunch of data types:
    - CHAR(x) => Store fixed-length strings e.g abbreviation, genre, so on.
    - VARCHAR(x) => Store variable-length strings e.g username, password, emails, addresses, so on.
                    maximum length is 65535 characters(~64kB)
    - MEDIUMTEXT => Store 16MB(16 Million characters), e.g json objects, short-medium length book, css strings
    - LONGTEXT => Store 4GB of textual data e.g text books, years of log files
    - TINYTEXT => Store 255 characters(bytes)
    - TEXT => Store 64KB, but is better VARCHAR because last one can be indexed(speed up our queries)

    We can also use these String data types to store numeric values like zip codes and phone numbers. Because
    we dont use these values in mathematical operations. Also these values may contain a hyphen(-) or 
    parenthesis to group a few digits.

    Is a good practice to use standard length for most of the VARCHAR columns:
    - 50 => for short strings for username, passwords
    - 255 => medium-length string for addresses
    This consistency simplify the maintain of our databases, so we dont have to constant check the length of each
    column


    Finally, all these types support international characters:
    - English letters uses 1 byte
    - European and Middle-eastern use 2 bytes
    - Asian languages use 3 bytes 

    So if the type of a column is CHAR(10) => MySQL will reserve 30 bytes for the values in that column
                                              because is the max bytes vaue when use Asian language
